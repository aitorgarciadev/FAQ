            <h2>FRONTEND DEVELOPMENT</h2>
            <div>
                <p>Front-end web development refers to the practice of building and designing the user interface of a
                    website or
                    application. This involves working with client-side technologies, such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript,
                    to create
                    interactive and visually appealing web pages.

            <h2>HTML</h2>
            <div>
                <p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the code used to structure and display a web page and its
                    contents. For example, its
                    contents could be paragraphs, a bulleted list, or images and data tables. As the title suggests,
                    this article will give
                    you a basic understanding of HTML and what its function is.

            <div>
                <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is the next technology we will learn after HTML. While HTML is used to
                    define the structure
                    and semantics of the content, CSS is used to style and position it visually. CSS can be used, for
                    example, to change the
                    font, color, size and spacing of content, to form multiple columns, add animations and other
                    decorative elements.</p>

            <h2>JAVASCRIPT</h2>
            <div>
                <p>JavaScript is a programming language that allows you to implement complex things on web pages. Any
                    time a web page does
                    more than just sit there and display static information for you to view - displaying timely content
                    updates, interactive
                    maps, 2D/3D animated graphics, scrolling video player machines, or more, you can bet JavaScript is
                    probably involved.

                <p>Part of the development that is dedicated to the programming of the different components of a website
                    (pages, forms,
                    functionalities, databases...) so that it works correctly. This is the logical part that the user
                    does not see, but is
                    essential for the elements to be displayed correctly. The back end works with different programming
                    languages such as
                    Java, PHP, MySQL...</p>
